## Project Philosophy

This component intentionally avoids:

- Framework dependencies
- Build steps
- Heavy abstractions
- Over-engineering

Every line of code must justify its existence.

If a feature adds complexity without significant value, it will likely be rejected.

Clarity > cleverness.  
Performance > novelty.  
Maintainability > trends.

## Reporting Bugs

When opening an issue, include:

- Browser and version
- Operating system
- Clear reproduction steps
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots or video (if helpful)

Minimal reproducible examples are strongly encouraged.

## Proposing Features

Before proposing a new feature, ask:

- Does this align with the core purpose?
- Can it be implemented without increasing bundle size significantly?
- Can it be achieved with CSS instead of JavaScript?
- Is it broadly useful?

Feature requests that introduce dependencies will not be accepted.
